#	DIJKSTRA'S ALGORITHM for MIPS assembly
#	Rom√°n Castellarin
#	Binary Heap as Priority Queue. Total complexity O((E + V) log V)

#	CONVENTIONS:
#	- Outgoing edge e=(d,v) is represented by word e = (d<<16) | v
#	- For a heap node n, its childrens are c1 = n<<1 and c2 = (n<<1)|1,
#	  and its parent is p(n) = n>>1
#	- $S0 := O.S. return address
#	- $S1 := |V| Number of Vertices
#	- $S2 := |E| Number of Edges
#	- $S3 := Priority Queue size
#	- $S4 := 0x1 (constant one)
#	- $S5 := 0x1000 #0x10000000 (infinity)
