earlier this week:
	We don't understand how memory should be mapped in a multitask OS. We leave that aside. Our simulation is simplified so as to not need $gp register and alikes.

	We try to understand how to encode the data segment into an executable. We find out that depends on the OS and has nothng to do with MIPS architecture. We invent own our executable format.

	Does the PC always point to the current instruction? Yes. We dug into the matter and discovered the truth.

15/03:
	We add support for floating point types, we struggle trying to find a way to check during compilation time that the machine is compliant with IEEE754 standards.
