Some notes...

In order to emulate the CPU, we have devised a small fictious OS.
 

EXECUTABLE FILE

- Header (12 bytes):
    4B : data-segment size (in Bytes)
    4B : text-segment size (in bytes)
    4B : main address

- Data Segment (<data-segment size>):
    Addresses start at 0x10000000

- Text Segment (<text-segment size>):
    Addresses start at 0x400000



ADDITIONALLY (not part of the executable of course),

Heap memory starts at 0x10010000

Stack memory ends at 0x7FFFFFFC

WE PROVIDE SOME SYSCALLS (see attached .pdf)
